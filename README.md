## Description

A landing page project that needs a dynamic menu navigation

## Languages

HTML , Css , javascript

## WhatIDid

What i did

- Build the navigation menu
- making the navigation dynamic by iterating through sections and creating list and anchor items
- using document fragment for better performance
- create links and adding attributes to them using dataset and id

- adding event listener to the ul to scroll programmatically to sections
  ps: doing that with the link href and using (scroll-behavior: smooth) in the css file is way more efficient but it was a challenge to do it through javascript

- creating an event listener for document scroll and call addActiveClass to iterate through sections and add your-active-class to the one in the viewport

I used some ideas and code guidance from https://www.w3schools.com/  and https://udacity.com
